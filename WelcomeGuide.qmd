## {{< iconify fa6-solid:mug-saucer >}} &nbsp; Coffee

There a **jura coffee machine** in the cafeteria. To use it you can ask **Alexis** (office xxx) to sell you a Coffee allocation sheet. 

We use those sheets to manage our shared coffee supply. Each sheet represents a *ration* of 30 cups of coffee. As people take coffee, they cross off one of the 30 boxes. When all boxes are crossed it's time to buy a new sheet.
